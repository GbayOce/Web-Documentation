			<h2>Reflection on proposal</h2>
			<p>
				In all honesty,there hasnt been much change from my web proposal to my web development in terms of style, however many changes
				have been made to properly accomodate the website on mobile and desktop devices. My goals for these project were to make
				sure everying gave a visual feedback, whether its hovering over a link, or clicking a button. Changes would either happen
				to the cursor or a colour change to the button. In addition, I took into consideration the hierachy of the content in
				regards to the mockup proposal. The new design now properly changes, allowing the website to be viewed on smaller screen
				devices to larger ones.
			</p>
			<h3 id="research">My Final Prototype: Iterations & Development</h3>
			<p>
				This is my website prototype. Ive made 2 pages, the landing page and the donate page. Every single button and link will do
				something and are hyperlink to relevant content based around the koalas in Australia. The news articles and Koala Foundation.
				links are all referenced below.
				<h3>Landing page</h3>
				<figure>
					<img src="
       https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/615908281507905556/781408045032276048/unknown.png?width=701&height=905
        "/>
        	</figure>
			This is a full scaled out image of the entire website. I've kept the koala ears at the top, with a banner just below it with the core image and call to action in the form of a donate button. 

      <br></br> 

      Structurally, the only changes ive made from the mockup proposal (shown below) is the position of the Latest Koala News as this declutters the initual landing page.

				<figure>
					<img src="
        https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/615908281507905556/772375303183269918/unknown.png?width=1305&height=905
        "/>
        	</figure>
     This was done to free up more space on the landing page, so audiences will not have too many competing images to grab their attention, rather directly being drawn towards the call to action. The big donate button. 
      <br></br>
      By moving the "Latest Koala news" down, it also made it much more accessable for mobile users as it can now freely squash and stretch without disturbing the hierarchy built on the upmost screen. 
   <br></br>
   However, based on some user feedback gained near the end of my website development suggested that "there was too much white space but i think thats not necessarily a bad thing". As mentioned in <a href="proposal.html"> my proposal </a> "The main image and message should be the core element in the landing page using salience to quickly deliver a striking, memorable and thought-provoking message" White space boosts this effect as nothing is competing for the audience's attention. 

   In development, the main issues that I came across was the spacing of the 4 news images and their text lining up, there is still some issue with the top 2 images being misaligned but i did my best with some spacers and line breaks to make it as pleasantly presented as possible. 
  Another issue i had was with the top koala ears, how my code works is that it squashes and stretches the image on the x axis to compensate for different window sizes, this leaves the ears looking different in shape on different devices. 
 </p> 
 	<h3>Donate page</h3>
   <p>
 The donate page used the same code from the landing page, editing only the image and adding the 2 columns, one for a thank you note to the donator and one for the form details to confirm the donation. 
  				<figure>

        https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/615908281507905556/781411259907964938/unknown.png?width=1264&height=905
        "/>
        	</figure>
Theres been significant change from the proposal wireframe as i wasnt happy with how it would look in that design, it would be unnessesary to give the user multiple options for different amounts of payment like it shows on the Australian Koala Foundation's donation page. As a single box specifying the amount would be sufficient. 
After some peer review, ive also added a confirm this donation button so users to make sure they want to commit to the decision.
